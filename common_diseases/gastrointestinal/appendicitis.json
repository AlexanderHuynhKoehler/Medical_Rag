        "Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it happens in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Treatment of appendicitis is usually antibiotics and, in most instances, surgery to remove the appendix."

        "A pocket of pus that forms in the abdomen. If the appendix bursts, a pocket of infection may develop. This is called an abscess. In most cases, a surgeon drains the abscess by placing a tube through the abdominal wall into the abscess. The tube is left in place for about two weeks, and antibiotics are prescribed to clear the infection.\nOnce the infection is clear, the appendix can be removed surgically. In some people, the abscess is drained, and the appendix is removed immediately."
