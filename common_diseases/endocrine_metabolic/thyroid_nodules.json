        "Thyroid cancer. The chances that a nodule is a cancer are small. But see a healthcare professional for a nodule that is large and hard or causes pain or discomfort.",
        "Factors that increase your risk of thyroid cancer include having a family history of thyroid or other endocrine cancers. A history of radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear fallout also raises the risk.",
        "Overgrowth of thyroid tissue. This is sometimes called a thyroid adenoma. It's unclear why this happens, but it isn't cancer. And it's not thought to be serious unless its size causes symptoms that bother you. Some thyroid adenomas can lead to hyperthyroidism.",
        "Thyroid cyst. Fluid-filled spaces in the thyroid called cysts most often come from thyroid adenomas that break down. Often, solid parts are mixed with fluid in thyroid cysts. Cysts usually are not cancer. But they sometimes have solid parts that are cancer.",
        "Multinodular goiter. A goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland. Lack of iodine in the diet or a thyroid problem can cause a goiter. A multinodular goiter has more than one nodule within the goiter. Its cause isn't clear.",
        "Thyroid cancer. The chances that a nodule is a cancer are small. But see a healthcare professional for a nodule that is large and hard or causes pain or discomfort. Factors that increase your risk of thyroid cancer include having a family history of thyroid or other endocrine cancers. A history of radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear fallout also raises the risk.",
        "Iodine deficiency. Lack of iodine in your diet sometimes can cause thyroid nodules. But iodine deficiency isn't common in the United States. That's because iodine is added to table salt and other foods in the United States."

        "Hyperthyroidism. Problems can happen when a nodule or goiter makes thyroid hormone. This leads to too much of the hormone in the body. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, muscle weakness, not being able to handle heat, and being anxious or cranky. Complications of hyperthyroidism include an irregular heartbeat and thinning bones.",
        "Problems swallowing or breathing. Large nodules or a multinodular goiter can cause neck discomfort and get in the way of swallowing or breathing.",

Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, muscle weakness, not being able to handle heat, and being anxious or cranky. Complications of hyperthyroidism include an irregular heartbeat and thinning bones.",
