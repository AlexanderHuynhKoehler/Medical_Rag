        "Hyperparathyroidism happens when there is too much parathyroid hormone in the blood. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone. The body has four of these glands. They are located behind the thyroid gland at the bottom of the neck. Each parathyroid gland is about the size of a grain of rice."

        "Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism sometimes may be so mild that they're hard to notice. Or the symptoms may seem like they're related to another health concern. If hyperparathyroidism isn't treated, symptoms might get worse over time.",
        "Hyperparathyroidism can cause a range of symptoms, including:",
        "Many people with primary hyperparathyroidism don't have symptoms. The condition often is found when a blood test that's done for another reason shows a high level of calcium in the blood.",
        "Urinating much more than usual.",
        "Often being thirsty.",
        "Tiring easily.",

        "See your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. Those symptoms could be triggered by other health conditions that cause hyperparathyroidism. And some of those conditions can lead to other serious health concerns. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism as soon as possible, so the cause can be found and treatment can begin right away."

      "section": "Causes",
      "content": [
        "Hyperparathyroidism is caused by factors that raise the amount of parathyroid hormone in the blood.",
        "When they're working correctly, the parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood with parathyroid hormone.",
        "Calcium is best known for its role in keeping teeth and bones healthy. But calcium also helps nerve cells send signals correctly. And calcium helps keep muscles healthy. Phosphorus, another mineral controlled by parathyroid hormone, works along with calcium to keep the body healthy.",
        "If one or more of the parathyroid glands makes a high amount of parathyroid hormone, that condition is hyperparathyroidism. There are two types of hyperparathyroidism: primary and secondary. They have different causes.",
        "When there's not enough calcium in the blood, the parathyroid glands typically make more parathyroid hormone. The hormone triggers a release of calcium from the bones. It also raises the amount of calcium absorbed by the small intestine from food. The hormone lowers the amount of calcium lost in urine too. Together, these changes raise the amount of calcium in the blood.",
        "When there's too much calcium in the blood, the parathyroid glands typically make less parathyroid hormone, and the calcium level in the blood drops."

        "Having too little calcium or too little vitamin D in your body for a long time. These conditions are called calcium deficiency and vitamin D deficiency.",
        "Having a rare, inherited disorder, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, that affects the parathyroid glands.",
        "Having changes in certain genes that can cause hyperparathyroidism.",
        "Having radiation treatment on the head or neck.",

      "section": "Complications",
      "content": [
        "Health issues that can happen because of hyperparathyroidism, called complications, are mainly related to the long-term effects of too little calcium in the bones and too much calcium in the blood.",
        "Common complications of hyperparathyroidism include:",
        "Osteoporosis. Too much parathyroid hormone in the blood causes loss of calcium from bones. That often leads to weak, brittle bones that break easily. This condition is called osteoporosis.",
        "Kidney stones. Too much calcium in the blood may lead to too much calcium in urine. This can cause small, hard deposits of calcium and other substances to form in the kidneys. Those deposits are called kidney stones.",
        "Health concerns in the heart and blood vessels. A high level of calcium in the blood is linked to some heart and blood vessel conditions, also called cardiovascular conditions. Examples include high blood pressure; a heartbeat that's too slow, called bradycardia; and a heartbeat that’s not regular, called arrhythmia."
