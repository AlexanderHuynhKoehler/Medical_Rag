        "Scoliosis is a side-to-side curve of the spine. It's most often diagnosed after age 10 or in the early teen years. The spine can curve to either side and in different parts of the back. Experts don't know the cause of most childhood scoliosis.",
        "Most scoliosis is mild. But some curves get worse as children grow. If the curve gets very bad, scoliosis can cause pain and breathing problems. A bad curve of the spine can push on the lungs and make it hard to breathe.",
        "Healthcare professionals watch growing children who have mild scoliosis with follow-up visits a few times a year. This most often involves X-rays and a physical exam to see if the curve is getting worse. Many people with scoliosis don't need treatment.",
        "Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from getting worse. Others may need surgery to correct the curves."

        "One side of the rib cage pushing forward.",
        "One side of the back poking out when bending forward.",
        "Most often with scoliosis, the spine rotates or twists as well as curving side to side. This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick out farther than those on the other side.",
        "See your child's healthcare professional if you see signs of scoliosis in your child. A mild curve might form slowly and not cause pain. You and your child might not know it's there. Sometimes, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis."
