        "Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that causes muscles to become weaker and lose mass over time. The condition is caused by changes in the genes that make proteins needed to form healthy muscles.",
        "There are many types of muscular dystrophy. Symptoms of the most common type start in childhood, mostly in boys. Other types sometimes don't start until adulthood.",
        "Medicines and other treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow the course of muscular dystrophy."

      "content": [
        "Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers. Most muscular dystrophy happens when one of these genes goes through an irregular change. You might hear this called a gene mutation.",
        "Each type of muscular dystrophy is caused by a gene change that is particular to that type of the disease. Most of these gene changes are passed from parent to child, also called inherited."

      "content": [
        "Muscular dystrophy occurs in people of all ages and ethnic groups. But the most common type, Duchenne, usually affects young boys. People with a family history of muscular dystrophy have a higher risk of getting the disease or passing it on to their children."

      "content": [
        "Muscular dystrophy can lead to serious health issues, such as the following:",
        "Trouble walking. In time, some people with muscular dystrophy will use a wheelchair for mobility.",
        "Trouble using arms. Daily activities can become harder if the muscles of the arms and shoulders are affected.",
        "Shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, called contractures. Along with the weakness caused by the muscular dystrophy, less range of motion in joints also can limit walking and arm use.",
        "Trouble breathing or coughing. Over time, muscular dystrophy can affect the muscles involved in breathing. Some people who develop serious trouble breathing might need to use devices that help keep the airways open or assist with breathing. Muscular dystrophy also can affect muscles that are used to cough. That can make it hard for the body to remove mucus from the lungs and windpipe. If your child has trouble coughing, ask your healthcare professional to recommend techniques or treatments that can help.",
        "Curved spine, also called scoliosis. This is most likely to happen in a growing child who can't walk. The curving may play a role in breathing troubles and challenges with getting into certain positions. Sometimes, surgery is needed to correct the curving.",
        "Heart problems. Muscular dystrophy can make it harder for the heart to pump well or beat with a regular rhythm.",
        "Swallowing problems. If the muscles involved with swallowing are affected, that can lead to trouble getting enough nutrition. Trouble swallowing also raises the risk of a lung infection caused by breathing food or liquid into the airways. This is called aspiration pneumonia. To lower these risks, nutrition may need to be given through a flexible device called a feeding tube.",
        "Brain-related differences. Some children with certain types of muscular dystrophy have challenges with learning, intelligence or social skills. For example, those with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may have higher rates of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety compared with people who don't have muscular dystrophy. If your child has a learning, intellectual or mental health condition, talk with your child's school. Ask for changes that can help your child learn more easily, called accommodations.",
        "Weakening bones. Children may have fewer minerals in their bones than usual. This is called low bone density. It can lead to weaker bones over time, especially in children who use wheelchairs. Low bone density raises the risk of broken bones, also called fractures. A healthcare professional might prescribe medicines to help strengthen weak bones."
