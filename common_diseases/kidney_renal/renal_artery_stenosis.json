        "Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis often begins with a physical exam that checks for swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms and groin and an enlarged spleen or liver. Other tests and procedures include blood tests, imaging tests and taking a sample of tissue for lab testing.",
        "Blood tests can sometimes show whether lymphoma cells are present. Blood tests may be used to test for viruses, including HIV, EBV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Blood tests also measure levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is often higher in people with lymphoma.",
        "Imaging tests make pictures of the body. They can show the location and extent of Hodgkin lymphoma. Tests might include CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.",
        "Your healthcare professional may suggest a lymph node biopsy or a biopsy of other tissue to look for cancer cells. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. A lymph node biopsy involves removing all or part of a lymph node. A sample may be taken from other parts of the body depending on symptoms and imaging test results. In the lab, tests may show whether you have Hodgkin lymphoma.",
        "Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are procedures to collect cells from the bone marrow for testing. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. Bone marrow has a solid part and a liquid part.",
        "In a bone marrow aspiration, a needle is used to collect a sample of the fluid. In a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to collect a small amount of the solid tissue. Most often, the samples are taken from the hip bone. The samples go to a lab for testing. For Hodgkin lymphoma, a healthcare professional may recommend this test only if blood counts are low and there isn't a clear reason for the low count.",
        "Lymphoma cells collected from a biopsy or a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy go to a lab for testing. In the lab, specialized tests look for specific things about the cells. The healthcare team uses the results to find out the type of lymphoma that you have.",
        "To learn whether the cells are Hodgkin lymphoma cells, the healthcare professionals in the lab look for proteins on the surface of the cancer cells. These proteins, known as markers, can help identify the type of Hodgkin lymphoma."

      "section": "Treatment",
      "content": [
        "Treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow transplant, also called bone marrow stem cell transplant, and clinical trials. Which treatment is best for you depends on the type of lymphoma you have and the extent of your cancer, called the stage. Your healthcare team also considers how quickly the cancer is growing, your overall health and what you prefer.",
        "Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. There are many chemotherapy medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form.",
        "Chemotherapy is often the first treatment for classic Hodgkin lymphoma. You may take a combination of chemotherapy medicines. Chemotherapy also may be combined with radiation therapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Chemotherapy may be an option when other treatments haven't worked, known as refractory lymphoma, or for cancer that comes back after treatment, called relapsed lymphoma.",
        "For nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, chemotherapy may be combined with immunotherapy.",
        "Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious long-term complications can happen, such as heart disease, lung damage, infertility and secondary cancers.",
        "Radiation therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you. The machine directs radiation to precise points in your body.",
        "For Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy is often combined with chemotherapy or other medicines. Radiation therapy may be the only treatment needed for early-stage nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. This treatment also may be used for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. For advanced cancer, radiation therapy may be used to ease symptoms and improve quality of life.",
        "Radiation therapy side effects include fatigue and a sunburnlike reaction on the skin at the site where the radiation is aimed. Other side effects depend on where the radiation is aimed. Radiation to the neck can cause dry mouth and damage the thyroid. Radiation to the chest can damage the heart and lungs.",
        "Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die.",
        "Targeted therapy may be a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. It's often combined with chemotherapy or other treatments. It also may be an option for refractory or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.",
        "Targeted therapy side effects may include diarrhea, liver issues, high blood pressure, issues with blood clotting and wound healing, fatigue, mouth sores, and nail changes. Most side effects go away after treatment is done.",
        "Immunotherapy for cancer is a treatment with medicine that helps the body's immune system kill cancer cells. The immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in the body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells.",
        "Immunotherapy may be combined with chemotherapy or other medicines to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunotherapy also may be used for refractory or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.",
        "Side effects of immunotherapy may include fever, chills, weakness, dizziness, aches, nausea and vomiting. Rarely, some immunotherapy treatments can cause an allergic reaction.",
        "A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. Stem cells can come from your own body, called an autologous transplant. Stem cells also can come from a donor, called an allogeneic transplant.",
        "A bone marrow transplant may be done for relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Chemotherapy is typically done before the transplant to suppress the immune system and bone marrow.",
        "Short-term side effects of a bone marrow transplant may include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, not feeling hungry, mouth sores, hair loss and skin reactions. Long-term side effects may include infertility, secondary cancers, organ damage, weakness in the bones or muscles, and cataracts.",
        "Clinical trials are studies of new treatments. These studies provide a chance to try the latest treatments. The risk of side effects might not be known. Ask your healthcare team if you might be able to be in a clinical trial.",
        "After treatment is complete, you may have frequent follow-up appointments to see if the cancer has come back, known as a relapse. You may have repeat blood and imaging tests and, if needed, biopsies, to check for a relapse.",
        "Treatments for lymphoma may have side effects. These may include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, rash, diarrhea, infection and more.",
        "More serious side effects from treatments may include:",
        "Bone marrow suppression. When the bone marrow is suppressed, it can't produce enough blood cells, including white blood cells. White blood cells help fight infections. With a lower amount of white blood cells, you are at a higher risk of infections.",
        "Febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is a serious condition that can happen in people being treated for cancer. Febrile means having a fever. Neutropenia means having a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. In febrile neutropenia, the body is trying to fight an infection but doesn't have enough neutrophils.",
        "Medicine toxicity. Some medicines used to treat cancer can be harmful to the body. They can cause organ damage and other issues. Whether a medicine is toxic depends on the type and how much you receive. There are many different medicine options. Your healthcare team can work with you to find the best medicines for you.",
        "Reactivating viruses. If you have had a viral infection in the past, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, some treatments can cause the virus to become active again. This can lead to liver inflammation, liver damage and other complications."
