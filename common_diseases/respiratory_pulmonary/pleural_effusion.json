        "Farsightedness is diagnosed by a basic eye exam, which includes a refraction assessment and an eye health exam.",
        "A refraction assessment determines if you have vision problems such as nearsightedness or farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia. Your eye doctor may use various instruments and ask you to look through several lenses to test your distance and close-up vision.",
        "Your eye doctor likely will put drops in your eyes to dilate your pupils for the eye health exam. This may make your eyes more light sensitive for a few hours after the exam. Dilation allows your doctor to see wider views inside of your eyes."

      "section": "Treatment",
      "content": [
        "The goal of treating farsightedness is to help focus light on the retina through the use of corrective lenses or refractive surgery.",
        "In young people, treatment isn't always necessary because the natural lens inside the eye is flexible enough to compensate for the condition. As you age, the lens inside the eye becomes less flexible. Eventually, you may need prescription lenses to improve your near vision.",
        "Wearing prescription lenses treats farsightedness by counteracting the decreased curvature of your cornea or the shorter length of your eye. Types of prescription lenses include:",
        "Eyeglasses. This is a simple, safe way to sharpen vision caused by farsightedness. The variety of eyeglass lenses is wide and includes single vision, bifocals, trifocals and progressive multifocals.",
        "Contact lenses. These lenses are worn right on your eyes. They are available in a variety of materials and designs, including soft and rigid, gas permeable in combination with spherical, toric, multifocal, and monovision designs. Ask your eye doctor about the pros and cons of contact lenses and what might be best for you.",
        "Although most refractive surgical procedures are used to treat nearsightedness, they also can be used for mild to moderate farsightedness. These surgical treatments correct farsightedness by reshaping the curvature of your cornea. Refractive surgery methods include:",
        "Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). With this procedure, an eye surgeon makes a thin, hinged flap into the cornea. The surgeon then uses a laser to adjust the curvature of the cornea to correct the farsightedness. Recovery from LASIK surgery is usually faster and causes less discomfort than other corneal surgeries.",
        "Photorefractive keratectomy, also called PRK. In the PRK procedure, the outer protective layer of the cornea, called the epithelium, is removed. A laser is then used to reshape the cornea. The epithelium is not replaced, but it will grow back naturally and conform to your cornea's new shape.",
        "Talk with your eye doctor about the possible side effects of refractive surgery."

        "You can't prevent farsightedness, but you can help protect your eyes and your vision by following these tips:",
        "Have your eyes checked. Do this regularly even if you see well.",
        "Control ongoing health conditions. Certain conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, can affect your vision if not treated.",
        "Protect your eyes from the sun. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet (UV) radiation.",
        "Prevent eye injuries. Wear protective eyewear when doing certain things, such as playing sports, mowing the lawn, and painting or using other products with toxic fumes.",
        "Eat healthy foods. Try to eat plenty of leafy greens, other vegetables and fruits. And studies show that your eyes benefit if you also include in your diet fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as tuna and salmon.",
        "Don't smoke. Just as smoking isn't good for the rest of your body, smoking can adversely affect your eye health as well.",
        "Use the right corrective lenses. The right lenses optimize your vision. Having regular exams will ensure that your prescription is updated.",
        "Use good lighting. Turn up or add light to see better.",
        "Reduce eyestrain. Look away from your computer or near-task work, including reading, every 20 minutes — for 20 seconds — at something 20 feet away.",
        "See a healthcare professional right away if you have any of these symptoms: Sudden loss of vision in one eye with or without pain; sudden hazy or blurred vision; double vision; or visual flashes of light, black spots or halos around lights. This may represent a serious medical or eye condition."

        "There are three kinds of specialists for various eye conditions:",
        "Ophthalmologist. This is an eye specialist with a doctor of medicine (M.D.) degree or a doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) degree followed by a residency. Ophthalmologists are trained to provide complete eye exams, prescribe corrective lenses, diagnose and treat common and complex eye conditions, and perform eye surgery.",
        "Optometrist. An optometrist has a doctor of optometry (O.D.) degree. Optometrists are trained to provide complete eye exams, prescribe corrective lenses, and diagnose and treat common eye conditions.",
        "Optician. An optician is a specialist who helps fit people for eyeglasses or contact lenses, using prescriptions from ophthalmologists and optometrists. Some states require opticians to be licensed. Opticians are not trained to diagnose or treat eye disease.",
        "Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.",
        "If you already wear glasses, bring them to your appointment. Your eye doctor has a device that can determine what type of prescription you have. If you wear contacts, bring an empty contact lens box from each type of contact you use.",
        "Tell your eye doctor about symptoms you have, such as trouble reading up close or difficulty with night driving, and when they began.",
        "Make a list of all medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take, including doses.",
        "List questions to ask your eye doctor.",
        "For farsightedness, questions to ask your eye doctor include:",

        "What are benefits and drawbacks to contacts?",
        "How often should I have my eyes examined?",
        "Are more-permanent treatments, such as eye surgery, an option for me?",
        "Do you have brochures or other printed material I can have?",
        "What websites do you recommend?",
        "Your doctor is likely to ask you questions, such as:",
        "How bad are your symptoms?",
        "Does your vision improve if you squint or move objects closer or farther away?",
        "Do others in your family use corrective lenses? Do you know how old they were when they began having trouble with their vision?",
        "When did you begin wearing glasses or contacts?",
        "Do you have any serious medical conditions, such as diabetes?",
        "Have you started any new medicines, supplements or herbal preparations?"
